# GeneXus Timer User Control

A GeneXus User Control that raises an event at user-defined intervals

### Installing

1. Download the files and place them under %GX_PROGRAM_DIR%\UserContorls\Timer
2. Run genexus.exe /install
3. Open GeneXus and drag the control from the toolbox and drop it anywhere in the form of an object. The place where you drop it within the form is not important, as the control has no visual behavior.

Check the documentation in the [GeneXus Community Wiki](https://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/wiki?8311,Timer+User+Control)
